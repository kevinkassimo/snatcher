This is a real-time UCLA course planner. 
We want you to gain the slightest edge, because seconds count when it comes to a popular class.
That's why we build a browser simulation to log onto myUCLA's course planner, refresh itself, and scrape all the latest info every minute or so.
You can be notified by email as soon as a spot opens up.

This is still a work in progress. In order to test-run it on your local machine, install
phantom.js from its official website and run main.js.
